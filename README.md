 Create a git repository with a brief description.
 
 # Homework 1
 
   Connect three potentiometers to a RGB Led, each potentiometer controlling the intensity of a color. To achieve this I used a breadboard, Arduino UNO board, 3 potentiometers, RGB Led, 3 resistors (330 Ohms) and connectivity wires.
      
   The solution along with a picture of the boards and a video showcasing the functionality are situated in the Laboratory 1 branch ( here is also a link to the video https://youtu.be/YtodR4_9IK0)
   
 # Homework 2:
  
   Recreate a traffic light intersection using LEDS and a button. To accomplish this, we need 3 LEDS ( Red, Green, Yellow) for the cars and 2 LEDS ( Red and Green) for the pedestrians and there will be four states:
      - First State: red for pedestrians, green for cars (rest of LEDS turned off) 
      - Second State : red for pedestrians, yellow for cars (rest of LEDS turned off)
      - Third State : green for pedestrians, red for cars (rest of LEDS turned off)
      - Fourth State : blinking green for pedestrians, red for cars (rest of LEDS turned off)
      
   A pedestrian may change the Traffic Light's state by pressing the button ( it can only change from state 1 to state 2, pressing the button in any other state won't have any effect).
