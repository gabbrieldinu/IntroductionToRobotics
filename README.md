     Connect three potentiometers to a RGB Led, each potentiometer controlling the intensity of a color. To achieve this I used a breadboard, Arduino UNO board, 3 potentiometers, RGB Led, 3 resistors (330 Ohms) and connectivity wires.
The solution along with a picture of the boards and a video showcasing the functionality are situated in the Laboratory 1 branch ( here is also a link to the video https://youtu.be/YtodR4_9IK0)
